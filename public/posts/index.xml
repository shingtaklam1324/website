      <title>Basic Logic in Lean</title>

      <description>A cool website for learning some basic logic is the Incredible Proof Machine, which can be found here. The web UI allows for the user to see what they&amp;rsquo;re doing, and how everything ties together. However, this UI can sometimes be a bit frustrating, and sometimes we end up spending more time than necessary creating the same sub-proof over and over again. So I got interesting in trying to port this to Lean, and see what it would be like to try and solve them in Lean instead.</description>

      <description>From personal experience, when learning an interactive theorem prover like Lean, there&#39;s a lot of &amp;quot;this should be obvious, now how do I do this&amp;quot; when getting started. Part of this is the rigour involved, as some things which may seem obvious are actually more subtle than it initially seems. In other cases, it may be that the approach taken by the mathematics library is different to the one used commonly.</description>

      <description>One thing that comes up frequently in mathematics is the idea of polynomials, and we would like to be able to reason on any polynomial. To do this requires us to develop the theory of polynomials.
To start off, we need the definition of polynomials. Wikipedia says
 In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables</description>
