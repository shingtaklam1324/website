<h2 id="lean">Lean<a href="#lean" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The main Lean project I&rsquo;ve been involved in is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">mathlib</a>, which is the community mathematics library. I have also submitted some PRs to the Lean community website as well as the community fork of Lean 3.</p>
<p>Personally, the first project I worked on was formalising a STEP question in Lean. This also involved an extension by building up the theory of polynomial derivations and solving the question using it. In the process, I also submitted a PR adding partial derivatives of multivariate polynomials to mathlib. A link can be found <a href="https://github.com/shingtaklam1324/step3-06-q8-lean">here</a>. Many thanks to Kevin Buzzard for his help.</p>
<h2 id="a-level-cs">A Level CS<a href="#a-level-cs" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Some things that I worked on during/about A Level Computer Science (specifically the CAIE exam board) can be found here.</p>
<p>During A Level CS, I wrote up a set of notes, mostly based on the textbook and past papers. The notes for AS (the first year) can be found <a href="https://shingtaklam1324.gitlab.io/compscinotes/ASNotes.html">here</a>, and the notes for A2 (the second year) can be found <a href="https://shingtaklam1324.gitlab.io/compscinotes/A2Notes.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I also wrote a transpiler for the pseudocode used by the exam board which outputs Python code. The compiler itself is written in Python, and the lexer/parser are hand written. It can be found <a href="https://github.com/shingtaklam1324/Pseudocode">here</a>.</p>
