Hello, I'm Shing. I am a first year undergraduate student reading Mathematics at
the University of Cambridge.

Below this introduction are some blog posts that I've written, most of which are
about formal methods in Mathematics, in particular using the Lean theorem prover.

For other things that I've done, or more about me, see the links at the top of
the page.
