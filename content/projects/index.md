This page has a partial list of the projects that I have worked on.

## Lean

The main Lean project I've been involved in is [mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib), which is the community mathematics library. I have also submitted some PRs to the Lean community website as well as the community fork of Lean 3.

Personally, the first project I worked on was formalising a STEP question in Lean. This also involved an extension by building up the theory of polynomial derivations and solving the question using it. In the process, I also submitted a PR adding partial derivatives of multivariate polynomials to mathlib. A link can be found [here](https://github.com/shingtaklam1324/step3-06-q8-lean). Many thanks to Kevin Buzzard for his help.

## A Level CS

Some things that I worked on during/about A Level Computer Science (specifically the CAIE exam board) can be found here.

During A Level CS, I wrote up a set of notes, mostly based on the textbook and past papers. The notes for AS (the first year) can be found [here](https://shingtaklam1324.gitlab.io/compscinotes/ASNotes.html), and the notes for A2 (the second year) can be found [here](https://shingtaklam1324.gitlab.io/compscinotes/A2Notes.html).

I also wrote a transpiler for the pseudocode used by the exam board which outputs Python code. The compiler itself is written in Python, and the lexer/parser are hand written. It can be found [here](https://github.com/shingtaklam1324/Pseudocode).
